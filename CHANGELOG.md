# Bond Changelog #

Notable changes--especially new features and **breaking changes**--are
recorded here.

Bond's version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
Each release is tagged with a Git tag. The
[NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bond.CSharp/) follow the Git
tag versions. The Bond compiler (`gbc`) and
[compiler library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bond) have a slightly
different versioning scheme, following the Haskell community's
[package versioning policy](https://wiki.haskell.org/Package_versioning_policy).

## Unreleased ##
* `gbc` & compiler library: (major bump already done in bond.cabal)
* IDL core version: TBD
* IDL comm version: TBD
* C++ version: (major bump needed)
* C# NuGet version: (minor bump needed)
* C# Comm NuGet version: TBD

### `gbc` and Bond compiler library ###

* C++ codegen now properly generates move assignment operator which was broken
  for some cases.
* C++ codegen no longer generates checks for C++11, except for MSVC 2013 workarounds.
* C++ codegen no longer generates data member initialization that invokes a constructor
  accepting `Comparer` for associative containers.
* C++ codegen now can generate copy and move constructors with an allocator argument
  when a custom allocator is used and `--alloc-ctors` is passed to `gbc`.
* C++ codegen now can generate [type aliases](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type_alias)
  that correspond to ones in IDL when `--type-aliases` flag is passed to `gbc`.
* C++ codegen now can use [`std::scoped_allocator_adaptor`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/scoped_allocator_adaptor)
  for strings and containers when custom allocator is used and `--scoped-alloc` flag
  is passed to `gbc`.
* C++ codegen now generates lazily constructed enum name-to-value and value-to-name maps.
  Additionally, a user-defined map type can now be provided to `GetNameToValueMap` and
  `GetValueToNameMap`.
* `import` statements can now end with an optional semicolon.
* C++ codegen now can generate types using the allocator concept using `--allocator-concept` is passed to `gbc` (http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/Allocator).

### C++ ###

* **Breaking change** Constructors accepting a `Comparer` have been removed from
  `bond::maybe` and `bond::nullable` types.
* The CMake build now enforces a minimum Boost version of 1.58. The build
  has required Boost 1.58 or later since version 5.2.0, but this was not
  enforced.
* gRPC v1.7.1 is now required to use Bond-over-gRPC.
* Fixed includes for gRPC services with events or parameterless methods.
  [Issue #735](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/735)
* Fixed a bug which would read an unrelated struct's field(s) when deserializing a
  base struct. [Issue #742](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/742)
* Fixed a bug in `bond::MapTo<T>::Field` where `Protocols` type parameter was
  not passed to `bond::Apply`.
* Fixed a race condition when `bond::ext::gRPC::io_manager::shutdown` and
  `bond::ext::gRPC::io_manager::wait` are called concurrently.
* Fixed a race condition during `bond::ext::gRPC::unary_call` destruction.

### C# ###

* The C# attribute `Bond.Attribute` can now be applied to methods. This
  fixes broken codegen when attributes are used on service methods.
  [Issue #617](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/617)
* Bond Attributes on service methods are now present on all the client
  overloads for the methods. Previously, just the "friendly" method had the
  attributes.

## 7.0.2: 2017-10-30 ##
* `gbc` & compiler library: 0.10.1.0
* IDL core version: 2.0
* IDL comm version: 1.2
* C++ version: 7.0.2
* C# NuGet version: 7.0.1
* C# Comm NuGet version: 0.14.0

### C++ ###

* Fixed a memory leak when deserializing Bond-over-gRPC messages that were
  stored as multiple slices.

### C# ###

* There were no C# changes in this release.

## 7.0.1: 2017-10-26 ##
* `gbc` & compiler library: 0.10.1.0
* IDL core version: 2.0
* IDL comm version: 1.2
* C++ version: 7.0.0
* C# NuGet version: 7.0.1
* C# Comm NuGet version: 0.14.0

### C# ###

* Fixes a regression introduced in 7.0.0 that resulted in an exception during
  generation of Serializer instances if the type contained an aliased
  `required` blob field.

## 7.0.0: 2017-10-24 ##
* `gbc` & compiler library: 0.10.1.0
* IDL core version: 2.0
* IDL comm version: 1.2
* C++ version: 7.0.0
* C# NuGet version: 7.0.0
* C# Comm NuGet version: 0.13.0

### `gbc` and Bond compiler library ###

* Add service/method annotations in C# for Comm and gRPC.
* Add service/method metadata support in C++ for gRPC.
* C++ codegen now uses [`std::allocator_traits`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/allocator_traits)
  for rebinding allocator types.

### C++ ###

* Added `bond::make_box` helper function to create `bond::Box<T>` instances.
* When Unicode conversion fails during JSON deserialization to wstring, a
  bond::CoreException is now thrown instead of a Boost exception.
* When SimpleJSON deserializes a map key with no matching value, a
  bond::CoreException is now thrown.
* When SimpleJSON deserializes a map key of non-primitive type, a
  bond::CoreException is now thrown.
* Errors from some versions of G++ like "non-template type `Deserialize`
  used as a template" have been fixed.
  [Issue #538](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/538)
* Guard against overflows in OutputMemoryStream, blob, and SimpleArray.
* Use RapidJSON's iterative parser to handle deeply nested JSON data without
  causing a stack overflow.
* Guard against min/max being function-style macros in more places.
* Allow Bond-generated C++ types to use non-default-constructable
  allocators. (This works even on MSVC 2013 by only compiling the
  generated-type's default constructor if it is used. The default
  constructor is now a templated constructor that is invokable with zero
  arguments.)
* Fixed some macro uses that did not have sufficient parenthesis around
  parameters and resulted in compiler errors.
* Added the `bond::ext::gRPC::shared_unary_call` type. This type can be used
  when shared ownership semantics are needed for `unary_call` instances.
* Provide compile-time access to metadata about gRPC services and methods.
* Using `bond::ext::gRPC::wait_callback` no longer causes a shared_ptr cycle
  and the resulting resource leak.
* Ensure that `bond_grpc.h` and `bond_const_grpc.h` are generated when the
  CMake variable `BOND_ENABLE_GRPC` is set to that importing `bond.bond` and
  `bond_const.bond` when defining a service works.
* Added `bond::capped_allocator` adapter that will allow to limit the max
  number of bytes to allocate during deserialization.

### C# ###

* **Breaking change** The code generation MSBuild targets no longer support
  Mono's xbuild: only MSBuild is supported. Mono has
  [deprecated xbuild in favor of MSBuild](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/releases/5.0.0/#msbuild)
  now that
  [MSBuild is open source and cross-platform](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild).
* **Breaking change** The code generation MSBuild targets now automatically
  compile the generated `_grpc.cs` files if `--grpc` is passed to `gbc`.
  Explicit `<Compile Include="$(IntermediateOutputPath)foo_grpc.cs" />`
  lines in MSBuild projects will need to be removed to fix error MSB3105
  about duplicate items. See commit
  [a120cd99](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/commit/a120cd9995d74e11b75766c5195ea4587c304dd7#diff-3b0b4bed9029ae89dbfb824ce7eff5e8R54)
  for an example of how to fix this.
  [Issue #448](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/448)
* **Breaking change** The low-level API `IParser.ContainerHandler` now has an
  `arraySegment` parameter for the converted blob.
* The code generation MSBuild targets will now skip compiling the
  `_types.cs` files when `--structs=false` is passed to `gbc`.
* Added `Bond.Box.Create` helper method to create `Bond.Box<T>` instances.
* Reflection.IsBonded now recognizes custom IBonded implementations.
* Use Newtonsoft's JSON.NET BigInteger support -- when available -- to
  handle the full range of uint64 values in the SimpleJson protocol (.NET
  4.5 or greater, .NET Standard 1.6 or greater).
* `Bond.IO.Unsafe.InputStream` can now be used with streams that do not
  implement [`Stream.Seek`][msdn-stream-seek], like
  [`System.IO.Compression.GzipStream`][msdn-gzipstream].
  [Issue #498](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/498)
    * Such streams are detected by inspecting
      [`Stream.CanSeek`][msdn-stream-canseek].
* Fix a bug in CompactBinaryWriter when using v2 that repeated first pass
  when a bonded field was serailized, resulting in extra work and extra
  state left in the CompactBinaryWriter.
* Apply IDL annotations to services and methods for gRPC.
  [Issue #617](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/617)
* Fixed a bug that produced C# code that couldn't be compiled when using
  Bond-over-gRPC with a generic type instantiated with a collection.
  [Issue #623](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/623)
* When targeting .NET 4.5, avoid resolving external entities when using
  `SimpleXmlReader`.
* Remove redundant conversions during serialization of aliased blobs.

### C# Comm ###

* Apply IDL annotations to services and methods for Comm.

## 6.0.1 ##

This version was not used.

## 6.0.0: 2017-06-29 ##
* `gbc` & compiler library: 0.10.0.0
* IDL core version: 2.0
* IDL comm version: 1.2
* C++ version: 6.0.0
* C# NuGet version: 6.0.0
* C# Comm NuGet version: 0.12.0

### `gbc` and Bond compiler library ###

* IDL support for service inheritance syntax
    * **Breaking change** In the Bond Haskell library, the `Service` type
      has a new field `serviceBase`.
* C++ codegen now generates
  [extern templates](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/function_template)
  of `bond::Apply` instead of overloads.
* C++ codegen hides FieldTemplate details, shortening symbol names.

### C++ ###

* **Breaking change** A C++11 compiler is now required. The minimum
  supported C++ compiler versions are now:
    * Clang 3.4 or newer
    * GNU C++ 4.7 or newer
    * Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 or newer
* **Breaking change** The generated apply.h/.cpp files now contain
  [extern templates](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/function_template)
  of `bond::Apply` instead of overload implementations. Calls to bare `Apply`
  or `TypeNamespace::Apply` must be changed to `bond::Apply`.
* **Breaking change** Users who are implementing custom streams are now
  required to provide the free functions `CreateInputBuffer`,
  `CreateOutputBuffer` and `GetBufferRange`, depending on which scenarios
  are used (there will be a corresponding compilation error for each case).
    * Users who were _mistakenly_ calling `bond::Merge<T>` with explicit an
      template argument will get a compilation error. To fix, remove the
      `<T>` part.
    * In addition, users of MSVC12 are required to define a `range_type`
      typedef as a return type of corresponding `GetBufferRange` inside
      their custom input buffer implementation.
    * Please see
      [InputBuffer](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/commit/11beaf5319639e4bdee96a25f95154e4fed93a75#diff-9260b18a00d12a6102a69b9fffd7e33f),
      [OutputBuffer](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/commit/11beaf5319639e4bdee96a25f95154e4fed93a75#diff-1f15d4c92f87d4bd41f705b20cce80ad),
      and
      [the bf example](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/commit/11beaf5319639e4bdee96a25f95154e4fed93a75#diff-bdda0f39d99280d4858b4453906eea17)
      for more details.
* **Breaking change** The `bond::customize<protocols>` has been removed. All the
  public APIs that require a protocol list (e.g. `bond::Marshal`) now accept
  an extra template argument `Protocols` which defaults to `bond::BuiltInProtocols`.
  Custom input streams now require `bond::type_id<>` to be specialized with a
  unique magic number. For more details please see [the bf example](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/tree/master/examples/cpp/core/bf).
* Initial support for sending
  [Bond objects over gRPC](https://microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/bond_over_grpc.html)
  has been added.
* The `bond::Apply` function now has a uniform signature. Call sites for the
  `Marshaler<Writer>` transform overload that were _mistakenly_ passing
  `Writer` explicitly (e.g. `bond::Apply<Writer>(marshaler, value)`) will
  now get a compiler error. To fix, remove the `<Writer>` part:
  `bond::Apply(marshaler, value)`.
* Fixed a bug that caused serialization using
  `CompactBinaryWriter<OutputCounter>` (to get the expected length of
  serializing with compact binary) to produced bogus results.
* Fixed
  [custom streams](https://microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/bond_cpp.html#custom-streams)
  support which was broken for some scenarios.
* For Visual C++ 2017 compability, RapidJSON v1.0.0 or newer is now
  required. The RapidJSON submodule that Bond uses by default has been
  updated to v1.1.0 due to a warning from clang in earlier versions.
* C++ codegen hides FieldTemplate details, shortening symbol names.

### C# ###

* **Breaking change** Support for .NET 4.0 has been dropped from the
  [supported frameworks](https://microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/bond_cs.html#frameworks-targeted).
* **Breaking change** The deprecated type `Bond.BondReflection` has been
  removed. The type `Bond.Reflection` should be used instead.
* **Breaking change** Bond assemblies are now
  [strong-name signed](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wd40t7ad(v=vs.110).aspx)
  with the
  [bond.snk](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/blob/82c97e12621eeb906d1bd46e3abba9da14289c61/cs/build/internal/bond.snk)
  key in the repository instead of with a Microsoft key. This allows anyone
  to produce compatible assemblies, not just Microsoft. Official
  distribution of Bond will continue to be
  [Authenticode signed](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537361(v=vs.85).aspx)
  with a Microsoft certificate.
  [Issue #414](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/414)
    * The new public key for assemblies is now
      `00240000048000009400000006020000002400005253413100040000010001000d504ac18b4b149d2f7b0059b482f9b6d44d39059e6a96ff0a2a52678b5cfd8567cc67254132cd2debb5b95f6a1206a15c6f8ddac137c6c3ef4995f28c359acaa683a90995c8f08df7ce0aaa8836d331a344a514c443f112f80bf2ebed40ccb32d7df63c09b0d7bef80aecdc23ec200a458d4f8bafbcdeb9bf5ba111fbbd4787`
* **Breaking change** Bond assemblies now have assembly and file versions
  that correspond to their NuGet package version. Strong name identities
  will now change release-over-release in line with the NuGet package
  versions. [Issue #325](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/325)
* The codegen MSBuild targets will now re-run codegen if gbc itself has been
  changed.
* Fixed a bug where JSON and XML protocols would permit the serialization of
  non-nullable string fields that were set to null instead of throwing a
  NullReferenceException.
  [Issue #417](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/417)

## 5.3.1: 2017-04-25 ##

* IDL core version: 2.0
* IDL comm version: 1.2
* C++ version: 5.3.0
* C# NuGet version: 5.3.1
* C# Comm NuGet version: 0.11.1

### C# ###

* Cleaned up documentation comments.

## 5.3.0: 2017-04-12 ##

* `gbc` & compiler library: 0.9.0.0
* IDL core version: 2.0
* IDL comm version: 1.2
* C++ version: 5.3.0
* C# NuGet version: 5.3.0
* C# Comm NuGet version: 0.11.0

### `gbc` and Bond compiler library ###

* C++ codegen ensures that parameter names do not shadow field names.
* When generating C++ apply files, there are now explicit `bond::Apply<>`
  instantiations for `CompactBinaryWriter<OutputCounter>` and
  `SimpleBinaryWriter<Null>` writers.
  [Pull request #373](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/pull/373)
    * **Breaking change (Haskell library only):**
      `Language.Bond.Codegen.Cpp.ApplyOverloads.Protocol` is now a union of
      `ProtocolReader` and `ProtocolWriter` to permit mixing and matching of
      reader/writer protocols without having to explicitly compute the full
      cross product.
* Add gbc flags to pick which C# files to generate (structs, gRPC, and
  comm). Only structs are generated by default.
* gbc ensures that method names are unique within a service.
  [Issue #381](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/381)

### C++ ###

* Fix Python shared_ptr converter build break with Boost 1.63.
* Improve compliance with
  [Microsoft's SDL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sdl/).
    * Bond now builds on MSVC with
      [`_CRT_SECURE_CPP_OVERLOAD_STANDARD_NAMES`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175759.aspx)
      instead of `_CTR_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS`.
    * Bond builds on MSVC with SDL recommended warnings enabled.
* Eliminate need for warning suppression on MSVC14 via warning.h in Bond
  itself. warning.h is still in place on MSVC12; furthermore, we don't alter
  warning.h for now as it may be depended upon by application code.
* Avoid unaligned memory access on non-x86/x64 platforms.
  [Issue #305](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/305)
* Improve compliance with strict-aliasing rules.
    * Bond now builds on Clang/GCC with `-fstrict-aliasing`.
* When generating C++ apply files, there are now explicit `bond::Apply<>`
  instantiations for `CompactBinaryWriter<OutputCounter>` and
  `SimpleBinaryWriter<Null>` writers.
  [Pull request #373](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/pull/373)
* Improve C++ allocator support
  [Issue #379](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/379)
  [Pull request #380](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/pull/380)
    * Support C++11 and above allocator model for rebind
    * Simplify detection of the default allocator
* Remove per-field instantiation of DynamicParser<>::UnknownFieldOrTypeMismatch method.

## C# ###

* Added gRPC integration. See the
  [Bond-over-gRPC manual](https://microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/bond_over_grpc.html).
* Added controls to cap incremental allocation between reads in
  `Bond.IO.Unsafe.InputStream`.
* Extended fix for bug parsing JSON when a string value is a date.
  [Pull request #358](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/pull/358)
* Bond C# 5.1.0 accidentally broke backward compability by renaming
  `Bond.Reflection` to `Bond.BondReflection`. This has been fixed:
  `Bond.BondReflection` was unrenamed back to `Bond.Reflection`, and a shim
  `Bond.BondReflection` type now redirects all calls to their original names
  to minimize further breakage.
  [Issue #369](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/369)
    * Code that started using `Bond.BondReflection` by name will encounter
      warning CS0618 indicating use of an obselete method/type. To fix this,
      use the original name `Bond.Reflection`. This warning can be
      suppressed if needed. However...
    * ...the shim type `Bond.BondReflection` will be removed during or after
      the next major release of C# Bond.

### C# Comm ###

* **Breaking change** To generate C# Comm files, be sure to pass the
  `--comm` flag to gbc.
  [See how the pingpong example was updated](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/blob/581d88632e0ad8b2fc87f5674273f613e78af752/examples/cs/comm/pingpong/pingpong.csproj#L39).
* C# Comm is now deprecated. We recommend that you use Bond-over-gRPC. See
  the
  [Bond-over-gRPC manual](https://microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/bond_over_grpc.html).
* EpoxyListener's StopAsync() now stops all the outstanding connections that
  it accepted.
* EpoxyTransport's StopAsync() now stops all the connections and listeners
  that it created.

## 5.2.0: 2017-02-07 ##

* `gbc` & compiler library: 0.8.0.0
* IDL core version: 2.0
* IDL comm version: 1.2
* C++ version: 5.2.0
* C# NuGet version: 5.2.0
* C# Comm NuGet version: 0.10.0

### `gbc` and Bond compiler library ###

* **Breaking change:** The C++ Comm .cpp template has been renamed to
  `comm_cpp` from `types_comm_cpp` to match the file it generates.
* Add export-attribute option for C++ and make apply-attribute a
  deprecated synonym for export-attribute
* Fix C++ Comm build problems when services are shared via DLL.
  [Issue #314](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/314)

### C++ ###

* Fixed compatibility with RapidJSON v1.1.0.
  [Issue #271](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/271)
* The minimum supported version of Boost is now 1.58
* The `bf` utility now supports multiple payloads.
  [Pull request #288](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/pull/288)
* Fixed an issue with aliased enums.
  [Pull request #288](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/pull/298)
* Fixed an issue with template parameter deduction in `bond::is_nullable`
  that occurs with Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Update 3.
  [Issue #306](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/306)

### C++ Comm ###
* Fixed a multiply-defined symbol linker error for
  `bond::comm::epoxy::detail::MakeConfigFrame`.

### C# ###

* Added controls to cap pre-allocation during deserialization of containers
  and blobs.
* Fixed computation of default value for aliased bool and wstring fields.
  [Issue #300](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issue/300)

### C# Comm ###

* Resources are now properly cleaned up if failures are encountered when
  establishing client-side Epoxy connections.
* The generated interfaces for services are now public. They were
  inadvertently internal before.

## 5.1.0: 2016-11-14 ##

* `gbc` & compiler library: 0.7.0.0
* IDL core version: 2.0
* IDL comm version: 1.2
* C++ version: 5.1.0
* C# NuGet version: 5.1.0
* C# Comm NuGet version: 0.9.0

### `gbc` and Bond compiler library ###

* **Breaking change:** The Haskell utility functions `structName` and
  `structParams` were renamed to `className` and `classParams` (in the
  `Language.Bond.Codegen.Cpp.Util` module).
* Added initial support for generating C++ Comm services and proxies.

### C++ Comm ###
* The initial C++ Comm code has been merged in, but there is still work left
  to be done before the first preview release. Use at your own risk.

### C# ###
* Bond C# now supports
  [.NET Standard 1.0, 1.3, and 1.6](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/26/introducing-net-standard/),
  so you can use Bond in .NET Core applications.
  [Pull request #243](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/pull/243)
    * Not all assemblies work with all versions of the .NET Standard or on
      all platforms. The
      [manual](https://microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/bond_cs.html#frameworks-targeted)
      lists which assemblies target which frameworks.
    * Bond C# Comm is not yet building with .NET Core toolchain, so its
      .NET Core support is preliminary.
* Bond.JSON now depends on Newsoft.JSON 9.0.1, the earliest version that
  supports .NET Standard 1.0.
* A new assembly, Bond.Reflection.dll, has been added, due to some internal
  refactoring needed for .NET Core support. Many of the Bond assemblies now
  have a dependency on this assembly, so you'll need to deploy it. If you
  use NuGet to consume Bond, this is should be handled automatically.
* Fixed a bug in the MSBuild targets that caused codegen to always be run if
  all of the BondCodegen items have Options metadata.
* Fixed a bug in the MSBuild targets that caused compilation to fail if the
  $BondOutputDirectory did not end with a trailing slash.

### C# Comm ###
* The constructor for `LayerStackProvider` no longer requires a logger;
  instead, the transport's logger is passed to `OnSend`/`OnReceive`. Before,
  using the same logger with a transport and `LayerStackProvider` required a
  duplicate implementation.
* Fixed a bug that prevented `EpoxyListener` from accepting multiple
  connections in parallel.

## C# Comm 0.8.0: 2016-10-12 ##

* C# Comm NuGet version: 0.8.0

### C# Comm ###
* `EpoxyTransport` can be configured to enable TCP keep-alive to help detect
  dead connections. See `EpoxyTransportBuilder.SetKeepAliveTimes` for
  details.

* **Breaking change:** `bond.TypeDef.list_sub_type` field removed, as it was
  breaking some consumers of serialized SchemaDef. We plan to restore this
  field in the future.

  it was breaking some consumers of serialized SchemaDef. We plan to restore
  this field in the future.
  [Issue #161 re-opened](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/161)
* Generated enum types now have a `FromEnum` method that can be used to
  convert from an enum value to a string. Now generated enum types have all
  four of `ToEnum`, `FromEnum`, `ToString`, and `FromString`. (The `...Enum`
  variants return false on failure, while the `...String` variants throw.)

  [Issue #212](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/212)

### C# Comm ###
* `EpoxyListeners` can now be configured to require clients to authenticate
  themselves with a certificate. This is configured via the
  `clientCertificateRequired` parameter when creating an
  `EpoxyServerTlsConfig`.
* Internals of the Epoxy protocol cleaned up. See the
  [updated wire format specification](https://microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/bond_comm_epoxy_wire.html).

## 4.3.0: 2016-08-23 ##

* `gbc` & compiler library: 0.5.0.0
* IDL core version: 1.0 (first release)
* IDL comm version: 1.0 (first release)
* C++ version: 4.3.0
* C# NuGet version: 4.3.0
* C# Comm NuGet version: 0.6.0

### `gbc` and Bond compiler library ###

* **Breaking change:** Runtime SchemaDef now includes information about
  whether BT_LIST fields are nullable or blobs.
  [Issue #161](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/161)
* User-defined `TypeMapping`s can now be created. This makes is easier to
  implement code generation for new languages. [Pull request
  #172](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/pull/172)
* Validate default value type mistmatches.
  [Issue #72](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/72)
  [Issue #128](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/128)
* Validate default value out-of-range values.
  [Issue #73](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/73)
* Fail when struct field has default value of `nothing`.
  [Issue #164](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/164)
* Fail when enum field doesn't have default value.
  [Issue #177](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/177)
* Validate default value of type aliases
* Generated types will used `= default` move constructors if possible. This
  results in many generated types having `noexcept` move constructors.
* Fix a bug where, if a Bond namespace contained a struct and an enum value with
  the same name, generated C++ would contain ambiguous references.
  [Issue #202](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/202)

### IDL core ###

* Set up a separate IDL directory so that IDL is independent of language
  bindings. [Pull request #219](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/pull/219)

### IDL comm ###

* Set up a separate IDL directory so that IDL is independent of language
  bindings. Convert comm IDL files to use C++-style naming convention. [Pull
  request #219](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/pull/219)

### C++ ###

* Improvements in the `nullable` implementation. [Pull request #174](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/pull/174)
    * Correctly use allocator model.
    * Reduce size of `nullable` in the normal case.
    * And others
* Runtime SchemaDef now includes information about whether BT_LIST fields
  are nullable or blobs.
  [Issue #161](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/161)
* The following Bond types have (possibly conditional) `noexcept` move
  constructors: `blob`, `bonded`, `maybe`, `nullable`, `RuntimeSchema`,
  `value`.

### C# ###

* Bond can now be used with Newtonsoft.Json >= 7.0.1 and < 10
* Runtime SchemaDef now includes information about whether BT_LIST fields
  are nullable or blobs.
  [Issue #161](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/161)

### C# Comm ###

* Logging interface revamped to make it non-static, eliminate boilerplate code, and to handle
  logging-related exceptions gracefully.
    * `LogHandler` renamed to `ILogSink`.
    * `TransportBuilder.SetLogSink` added to associate a logger with a
      transport.
    * `TransportBuilder.EnableDebugLogging` added to control whether debug
      logs are emitted or not.
    * The `ILogSink.Log` method is now provided a pre-formatted string
      instead of a format string and its arguments.
* Transport is now parameterized with Connection and Listener
  implementations. This eliminates the need to cast the results of
  `transport.ConnectToAsync()` and `transport.MakeListener()` to
  transport-specific subtypes.
* Epoxy has a hook for performing custom host to IP address resolution. This
  is configured with `EpoxyTransportBuilder.SetResolver`.
* Bond-generated Errors now give clients opaque GUIDs. These GUIDs can be
  matched against emitted metrics for debugging.
* Epoxy can now be configured to use TLS to secure the connection.
    * TLS configuration is set via
      `EpoxyTransportBuilder.SetClientTlsConfig`/`EpoxyTransportBuilder.SetServerTlsConfig`.
    * See the
      [TLS example](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/tree/master/examples/cs/comm/tls/)
      for even more details.

## 4.2.1: 2016-06-02 ##

* C# Comm NuGet version: 0.5.0

### `gbc` ###

* Support for parsing
  [service definitions](https://microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/compiler.html#service-definition)
  and generating C# service bases, interfaces, and proxies.
    * New types for
      [services](https://microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/compiler.html#services)
      and
      [methods](https://microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/compiler.html#methods)
      have been added to the compiler AST.
* MSBuild-compatible error messages.
  [Issue #136](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/136)

### C# ###

* Added
  [`Deserializer.TryDeserialize()`](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/blob/db315adaf4b812adc5ca484b1bcffafe1df6d351/cs/src/core/Deserializer.cs#L231-239).
* Added two new
  [NuGet packages](https://microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/bond_cs.html#nuget-packages)
  to make it easier to consume Bond piecemeal.
    * Bond.Compiler: contains `gbc`, `bond.bond`, and `bond_const.bond` in a
      tools-only package
    * Bond.Compiler.CSharp: contains `gbc` and C# MSBuild targets. No longer
      do you have to consume Bond.CSharp (which pulls in all of the rest of
      Bond) just to get codegen.

  [Issue #114](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/114).
* Fix for SimpleXmlParser not handling XML declarations. [Issue #112](https://github.com/Microsoft/bond/issues/82)

## Breaking changes between 3.x and 4.x ##

Bond C# had the following breaking changes introduced in 4.x compared to the
3.x versions:

* The
  [Bond.Core.CSharp NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bond.Core.CSharp/)
  was introduced so that not all uses of Bond depend on Json.NET. The
  [Bond.Runtime.CSharp package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bond.Runtime.CSharp/)
  still depends on Json.NET and also depends on Bond.Core.CSharp. The
  primary package remains Bond.CSharp.
* `CompactBinaryReader<InputStream>` now
  [explicitly implements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/programming-guide/interfaces/explicit-interface-implementation)
  `ICloneable<CompactBinaryReader<InputStream>>` instead of implicitly.
  `FastBinaryReader` and `SimpleBinaryReader` were likewise changed.
